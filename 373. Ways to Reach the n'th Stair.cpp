Min Cost Climbing Stairs
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 50.04%Submissions: 17K+Points: 4
Given an array of integers cost[] where cost[i] is the cost of the ith step on a staircase. Once the cost is paid, you can either climb one or two steps. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
Assume 0-based Indexing. You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

Examples:

Input: cost[] = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest option is to start at cost[1], pay that cost, and go to the top.



Input: cost[] = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest option is to start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].


Constraints:
2 â‰¤ cost.size() â‰¤ 105
0 â‰¤ cost[i] â‰¤ 999

/**
 * Approach:
 * - Define `solve(i)` as the **minimum cost** to reach step `i`.
 * - You can start from **index 0 or index 1**.
 * - **Recurrence relation:** `dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i+1], dp[i+2])`
 * - Base case: If `i >= n`, return `0` (no more cost).
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ **Time Complexity:** O(N) â†’ Each state is computed once.
 * ðŸ”¹ **Space Complexity:** O(N) â†’ Recursion stack + dp array.
