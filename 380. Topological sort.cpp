Given an adjacency list for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where adj[u] contains a list of all vertices v such that there exists a directed edge u -> v. Return topological sort for the given graph.

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
Note: As there are multiple Topological orders possible, you may return any of them. If your returned Topological sort is correct then the output will be 1 else 0.

Examples:

Input: adj = [[], [0], [0], [0]] 

Output: 1
Explanation: The output 1 denotes that the order is valid. Few valid Topological orders for the given graph are:
[3, 2, 1, 0]
[1, 2, 3, 0]
[2, 3, 1, 0]
Input: adj = [[], [3], [3], [], [0,1], [0,2]]

Output: 1
Explanation: The output 1 denotes that the order is valid. Few valid Topological orders for the graph are:
[4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3]
[5, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3]
Constraints:
2  â‰¤  V  â‰¤  103
1  â‰¤  E  â‰¤  (V * (V - 1)) / 2

// ---------------------------------------------------------
// ðŸš€ Approach, Intuition, Time & Space Complexity:
//
// Approach & Intuition:
// - Use **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based Topological Sort)**.
// - First, calculate the in-degree of every vertex.
// - Push all vertices with in-degree 0 into a queue.
// - Pop elements from the queue, add to result, and reduce in-degree of neighbors.
// - If in-degree becomes zero, push it into the queue.
// 
// Time Complexity: O(V + E)
// - V = number of vertices
// - E = number of edges (since we traverse all edges)
//
// Space Complexity: O(V + E)
// - Adjacency list: O(E)
// - In-degree array & result: O(V)
// - Queue storage: O(V)
