Activity Selection
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 36.21%Submissions: 146K+Points: 4Average Time: 20m
You are given a set of activities, each with a start time and a finish time, represented by the arrays start[] and finish[], respectively. A single person can perform only one activity at a time, meaning no two activities can overlap. Your task is to determine the maximum number of activities that a person can complete in a day.

Examples:

Input: start[] = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5], finish[] = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
Output: 4
Explanation: A person can perform at most four activities. The maximum set of activities that can be executed is {0, 1, 3, 4}
Input: start[] = [10, 12, 20], finish[] = [20, 25, 30]
Output: 1
Explanation: A person can perform at most one activity.
Input: start[] = [1, 3, 2, 5], finish[] = [2, 4, 3, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: A person can perform activities 0, 1 and 3.
Constraints:
1 â‰¤ start.size() = finish.size() â‰¤ 2*105
1 â‰¤ start[i] â‰¤ finish[i] â‰¤ 109

/*
    ðŸ”¹ Approach:
    - Store activities as **(finish time, start time)** pairs.
    - **Sort** the activities based on their finish time.
    - Use **Greedy Selection**:
      - Always pick the activity that finishes earliest and does not overlap.
      - If the current activity starts after the last selected one ends, select it.

    ðŸ”¹ Intuition:
    - Sorting by finish time ensures we **maximize** the number of activities by always choosing the **earliest finishing** valid activity.
    - This is a classic **greedy algorithm**.

    ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity:
    - **O(N log N)** due to sorting.

    ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity:
    - **O(1)** as we use only a few extra variables.
