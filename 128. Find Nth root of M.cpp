Find Nth root of M
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 25.06%Submissions: 117K+Points: 2
You are given 2 numbers (n , m); the task is to find nâˆšm (nth root of m).
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, m = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 32 = 9
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, m = 9
Output: -1
Explanation: 3rd root of 9 is not
integer.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function NthRoot() which takes n and m as input parameter and returns the nth root of m. If the root is not integer then returns -1.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n* log(m))
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 30
1 <= m <= 109

/*
 * Intuition:
 * To find the n-th root of a number m, we can use a binary search approach to search for an integer k such that k^n = m.
 * If no such integer exists, return -1.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(log m * log n), where m is the input number and n is the root. The outer binary search runs in O(log m), and each power computation runs in O(log n) due to repeated multiplication.
 * Space Complexity: O(1), as the solution uses constant extra space.
