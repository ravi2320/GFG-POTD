Dice throw
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 36.52%Submissions: 37K+Points: 4Average Time: 30m
Given n dice each with m faces. Find the number of ways to get sum x which is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.

Example:

Input: m = 6, n = 3, x = 12
Output: 25
Explanation: There are 25 total ways to get the Sum 12 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 6.
Input: m = 2, n = 3, x = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only 1 way to get the Sum 6 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 2. All the dices will have to land on 2.
Constraints:
1 <= m,n,x <= 50
*/

/*
Approach:
- Use recursive dynamic programming with memoization to count the number of ways to get a sum `x` using `n` dice with `m` faces.
- At each step, we try all possible face values from 1 to m and recursively reduce the target sum.
- Store intermediate results in a dp table to avoid recomputation.

Intuition:
- If we use all dice (i == n), we check if the remaining target sum is 0. If yes, itâ€™s a valid way.
- Otherwise, for each die, we try all values from 1 to m and recursively check if we can reach the target.

Time Complexity: O(n * x * m)
Space Complexity: O(n * x) for the dp table and O(n) recursion stack depth

            return curr == 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }

        // If remaining sum is negative, not a valid configuration
        if (curr < 0) return 0;

/*
Approach:
- Use bottom-up dynamic programming (tabulation).
- Define dp[i][j] as the number of ways to get a sum `j` using `i` dice.
- Build up the solution iteratively:
    - For each number of dice from 1 to n,
    - For each possible sum from 1 to x,
    - Try all face values from 1 to m and accumulate the count of ways.

Intuition:
- To get sum `j` with `i` dice, try all face values `f` such that `j - f` is a valid sum with `i - 1` dice.
- Add all possible ways from previous state `dp[i - 1][j - f]` to current state.

Space Complexity: O(n * x)
