K Sized Subarray Maximum
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 26.04%Submissions: 329K+Points: 4
Given an array arr[] and an integer k. Find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.

Examples:

Input: k = 3, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6]
Output: [3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6] 
Explanation: 
1st contiguous subarray = [1 2 3] max = 3
2nd contiguous subarray = [2 3 1] max = 3
3rd contiguous subarray = [3 1 4] max = 4
4th contiguous subarray = [1 4 5] max = 5
5th contiguous subarray = [4 5 2] max = 5
6th contiguous subarray = [5 2 3] max = 5
7th contiguous subarray = [2 3 6] max = 6

Input: k = 4, arr[] = [8, 5, 10, 7, 9, 4, 15, 12, 90, 13]
Output: [10, 10, 10, 15, 15, 90, 90]
Explanation: 
1st contiguous subarray = [8 5 10 7], max = 10
2nd contiguous subarray = [5 10 7 9], max = 10
3rd contiguous subarray = [10 7 9 4], max = 10
4th contiguous subarray = [7 9 4 15], max = 15
5th contiguous subarray = [9 4 15 12], max = 15
6th contiguous subarray = [4 15 12 90], max = 90
7th contiguous subarray = {15 12 90 13}, max = 90
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(k)

Constraints:
1 ≤ sizeof(arr) ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ sizeof(arr)
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

/*
 * Approach:
 * 1. Use a deque (double-ended queue) to maintain indices of elements in a sliding window of size `k`.
 * 2. The deque stores indices in a way that the elements corresponding to these indices are in decreasing order.
 * 3. For each new element:
 *    - Remove indices from the front that are out of the current window.
 *    - Remove indices from the back where the corresponding values are less than the current element, 
 *      as they will not be the maximum in the current or any future window.
 *    - Add the current index to the deque.
 *    - If the window size has reached `k`, the front of the deque is the index of the maximum element in the current window.
 * 4. Append this maximum to the result list.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the size of the array. Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once.
 * Space Complexity: O(K), the maximum space used by the deque which is limited to the size of the window.
