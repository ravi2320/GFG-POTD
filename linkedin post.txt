🚀 Day 8(9-Jun-2024): Advancing in the DSA with Development Journey 🚀

Hello #linkedinfamily,

Welcome to Day 8 of my journey in advancing Data Structures and Algorithms and development.

🔍 DSA Section: Today, I solved:
    1. 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K in LeetCode daily challenge.
    2. Convert array into Zig-Zag fashion in GFG POTD
    3. Basic Array Questions from Striver's A2Z series:
	• 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated
	• 189. Rotate Array
	• 283. Move Zeroes

💻 Development Section: In the Spring series today, I studied:
    1. Spring standalone collections such as List, Map, and Properties are used to configure and inject collections of beans directly through XML or annotations
    2. I have learned about Stereotype Annotations in Spring, including the @Component annotation for marking beans and the @Value annotation for injecting values into fields from configuration sources.
    3. collections with the @Value annotation in Spring 
    4. Spring Bean scopes configured through XML and annotations for defining bean lifecycles.

Excited to keep progressing and sharing my journey with you all. See you on Day 8!
